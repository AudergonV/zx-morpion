# ZXMorpion
A "Tic-Tac-Toe" game made with Sinclair BASIC

## How to play the game
There is a .tap file in the repo, which is the compiled code. Load this file in a ZX Spectrum emulator.
I advise you to use the 'qaop' emulator, available here: [http://torinak.com/qaop](http://torinak.com/qaop)
Press F9, then open the maze.tap file
## How to compile the game
If you want to do some modifications to the source code and compile it, use the zxbasic compiler ([https://bitbucket.org/zxbasic/zxbasic](https://bitbucket.org/zxbasic/zxbasic))
